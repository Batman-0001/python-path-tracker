# python-path-tracker
this is a project built via some gis modules that exist in python such as osmnx and folium.
this basically can be used to get the shortest and fastest path between two points on the map which can be chosen by the user.
then it has also a dummy program to show which path has less pollution.(the data it analyses is random dummy data the program itself generates.)
